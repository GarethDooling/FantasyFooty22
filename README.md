# Fantasy Football 2022 by Gareth Dooling

# Objective

- To create a web application that integrates with a database and demonstrates CRUD functionality.
- To utilise containers to host and deploy the application.
- To create a continuous integration (CI)/continuous deployment (CD) pipeline that will automatically test, build and deploy the application.

This will require use of the following technologies/concepts:

- Project Management
- Python Fundamentals
- Python Testing
- Git
- Linux
- Python Web Development
- Databases
- Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
- Cloud Fundamentals
- Containerisation

## Part 1: Project Initiation

I propose to create a simple fantasy football application relating to two tables; 'Team' and 'Players'. The app will demonstrate CRUD functionality so a user will be able to create, read, update and delete teams and players. 

## Part 2: Planning, Design & Project Tracking
